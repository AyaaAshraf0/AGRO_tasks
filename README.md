# Mobile Robot Tasks - Internship

This repository contains mobile robot tasks performed during my internship, including navigation and manipulation simulations using different robots in an agricultural world.

## Projects Included

1. *Custom Worlds Package*: Contains custom world for agricultural environment, built for ROS2 and Gazebo.
2. *Navigation with Turtlebot3 Burger*: Implements navigation using the Turtlebot3 Burger in the agricultural world, including localization and path planning.
3. *Franka Panda Manipulator Simulation*: Simulation of the Franka Panda manipulator in a Gazebo environment with ROS2 control integration.
4. *Tiago Mobile Manipulator*: Integrates both navigation and manipulation tasks for the Tiago robot in the agricultural world.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- ROS 2 Humble installed
- Gazebo classic.
- (Optional) Docker (if running using a container)

*To install Docker Engine*, I followed [this tutorial](https://aleksandarhaber.com/how-to-create-and-run-ros2-packages-in-docker-containers-from-scratch/)

## Installation
1. *Clone the repository* and initialize it as a ROS 2 workspace:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AyaaAshraf0/AGRO_tasks.git
